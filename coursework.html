      <h2> Synopsis </h2>
      <p> Train to Busan is a 2016 South Korean zombie action horror film, directed by Yeon Sang-Ho. The majority of the film takes place on a train which is heading for Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of the passangers.
      </p>
      <p> A chemical leak at a biotech plant causes the start of a zombie apocalypse that slowly spreads across South Korea. Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. After being overcome with guilt after watching a video of Su-an suffering from stage fright while singing "Aloha 'Oe" at a recital due to his absence, he decides to take her to Busan via an early KTX 101 from Seoul Station. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong; selfish COO Yon-suk; a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and team cheerleader Jin-hee; elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil; and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, signs of chaos from the epidemic reach the station, and an infected woman runs inside, unnoticed, just before the doors close. The infection quickly spreads throughout the train, leaving a select few to try and fight their way through hoards of infected towards the front of the train. Will they make it to Busan?
